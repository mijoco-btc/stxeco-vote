;; Title: SIP-031: Five-Year Stacks Growth Emissions
;; Author(s): Mitchell Cuevas, Alex Miller, Tycho Onnasch, Jakob Schillinger, Andre Serrano
;; Dylan Floyd
;; Synopsis:
;; A dedicated Stacks Endowment to manage a consolidated STX treasury focused on ecosystem growth.
;; Description:
;; The treasury will be created through ongoing token emissions over the next five years and seed STX 
;; transfers from key contributors. The new proposed structure will allow for more efficient execution among 
;; contributors by organizing efforts around a new operational entity that will provide both the capital and 
;; structure needed to make strategic investments in user and builder focused incentives, additional development 
;; capacity, security, marketing, liquidity, and business development initiatives needed to fuel the Stacks 
;; ecosystem during this next phase of growth.
